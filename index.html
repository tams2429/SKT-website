                    <h3>About me</h3>
                    <p>
                        I am an aspiring developer with a particular interest towards the Front-End aspect. 
                        With regards to this, I have focused primarily on self-learning HTML, CSS and Javascript 
                        through the use of online resources including FreeCodeCamp, Codewars and Youtube.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This is my first website and has been created to support my application to a coding bootcamp, 
                        from a combination of HTML, CSS and Vanilla Javascript.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        For the past 4 years, up until 6 months ago, 
                        I went straight from a Civil Engineering degree in university to working in the industry. 
                        However, I couldn’t shake off a lack of fulfilment in the job I was doing.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Having dabbled in coding from time to time outside of work and experiencing the euphoria 
                        that comes with a eureka moment after struggling through a problem for so long, I wish to 
                        start anew in my career, with coding, where I feel a sense of satisfaction in the work I do.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        However, as work began to pick up and my time to code became more limited, 
                        I decided to fully commit to the cause and quit my job, which takes me to where I am now. 
                        Ready and looking for any opportunity that is out there.

        <!----------------Why I am applying -------------------->
        <section class="sec3" id="application">
            <div class="content">
                <h3>Why am I applying to F&C?</h3>
                <p>
                    Through the many struggles that I have encountered since learning to code, 
                    I know all too well how difficult it can be to keep going on your own, 
                    especially when a simple google search/stack overflow seems to always not 
                    provide the answer simple enough for someone starting out to understand. 
                    As the saying goes, ‘Two minds are always better than One’, or in the case of F&C, 
                    a whole class cohort can be my best friend in developing/learning to code.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In addition to providing me with a constructive learning environment, 
                    I hope that F&C will be able to provide me with the solid foundation that I need 
                    in order to get my foot in the door to a highly competitive industry. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    As someone who is also lacking in experience, the idea of having a project for a real, 
                    external client is also something I am very keen about. One which, I know that F&C are 
                    able to provide along with tools outside of coding including design and entrepreneurship.
                </p>
